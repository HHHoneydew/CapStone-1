This is a Java-based Command Line Interface (CLI) application designed to track financial transactions for personal or business use.

All data is stored in a CSV file named `transactions.csv`.

### Interesting Piece Of Code

Explantion:
I used this to help me display the different screen options instead of manually writing a System.OutPrint for each option. Imagine there are 100 options and manually writing System.OutPrint for each is insane!
